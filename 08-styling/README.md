This repository contains a React app that demonstrates four different approaches to styling a React application:

1. **Default Styling with Inline CSS and CSS Modules**
2. **CSS Preprocessors (SASS)**
3. **CSS-in-JS with Styled Components**
4. **CSS Framework (Material UI)**

## How to Run the App

1. Navigate to the root directory:
   ```
   cd styling-react-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
