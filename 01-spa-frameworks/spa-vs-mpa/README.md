# Application Architecture Comparison

This directory contains two separate applications built using different architectural approaches: a Single Page Application (SPA) developed with React and a Multi-Page Application (MPA). The purpose of this comparison is to showcase the differences between these two approaches in terms of development, user experience, and performance.

## Single Page Application (React)

The SPA is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To run the SPA, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `spa-app` directory: `cd spa-react-app`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

In this SPA, you'll notice that the entire application is loaded as a single HTML page. Navigation between different sections of the app happens without full page reloads. This approach can lead to a smoother user experience, as only the required components are updated.

## Multi-Page Application (HTML/CSS/JS)

The MPA is built using traditional HTML and CSS. To run the MPA, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `mpa-app` directory: `cd mpa-app`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser

In the MPA, each page is a separate HTML file, and navigation between pages typically involves full page reloads. This approach might be suitable for simpler applications where separate pages make sense.

### Key Differences

- Loading: The SPA loads all necessary assets upfront, making subsequent navigation smoother. The MPA loads assets on-demand, leading to longer initial load times.
- User Experience: The SPA offers a more seamless and responsive experience due to its ability to update specific components without refreshing the entire page. The MPA may feel slower due to full page reloads.
- Development: The SPA requires knowledge of React and its ecosystem. The MPA relies on standard web technologies.
- SEO: The SPA might need additional configuration for search engine optimization, whereas the MPA is more SEO-friendly out of the box.
- Performance: SPAs can sometimes suffer from slower initial load times, while MPAs may load faster initially but might feel slower during navigation.

Feel free to explore both applications to understand how these architectural approaches impact user experience and development.
