# React JSX Example

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of JSX (JavaScript XML), which is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React for defining UI elements.

## About JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making it more readable and expressive.

In this example, you'll see how JSX works:

### JSX Element

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```
In the code above, element is a JSX element representing an `<h1>` heading with the text "Hello, JSX!".

### Using JSX in Components

This React app uses JSX within the App component:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {element}
      <p>2 + 2 = {2 + 2}</p>
      {renderGreeting("John")}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- JSX elements are returned within the render method of a component.
- You can embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} within JSX, as shown with 2 + 2.
- JSX allows you to call functions and use variables, such as renderGreeting("John").

## Running the App

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the jsx-exemplary-app directory::

   ```bash
   cd jsx-exemplary-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You will see the app displaying JSX elements and expressions.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment further with JSX.
