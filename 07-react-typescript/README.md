# React and TypeScript Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of React with TypeScript. TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, and when combined with React, it provides benefits like improved code quality, better development tooling, and enhanced maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Strong Typing**: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, helping catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This leads to more reliable code.

- **Enhanced Tooling**: TypeScript comes with excellent development tools like autocompletion, type inference, and advanced refactoring tools, which significantly improve the development experience.

- **Improved Maintainability**: Type definitions provide clear contracts of what a function or component expects, making the codebase more maintainable, especially in larger projects or team environments.

## Example

In this app, TypeScript is used throughout the project. For example, the `Todo` component expects a prop of type `TodoItem`, and the `todos` state is defined as an array of `TodoItem` objects. TypeScript enforces these types, ensuring that only valid data is used.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

interface TodoItem {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

const Todo: React.FC<{ todo: TodoItem }> = ({ todo }) => {
  return (
    <li>
      <span>{todo.text}</span>
      <button className="delete">Delete</button>
    </li>
  );
};

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<TodoItem[]>([]);
  // ...
};
```

This ensures that you're working with the correct data types and helps prevent runtime errors.
