# React Component Structure Example

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the basic structure of React components.

## Components

In this example, we have two main components:

1. **App Component**: The top-level component that acts as the container for our application. It includes the `Header` and `Content` components.

2. **Header Component**: A child component responsible for rendering the application's header. It displays a title.

3. **Content Component**: Another child component responsible for rendering the application's main content. It displays a paragraph of text.

## Component Hierarchy

Here's a visual representation of the component hierarchy:

- App (Top-Level)
  - Header
  - Content

## Running the App

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the react-component-structure directory::

   ```bash
   cd react-component-structure
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Feel free to explore the code to understand how the components are structured and how they work together to build a simple React application.

This example serves as a starting point for understanding React's component-based architecture. You can build more complex applications by creating and composing different components based on your project requirements.
